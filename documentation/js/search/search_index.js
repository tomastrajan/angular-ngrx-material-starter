would love for you to contribute to starter project and help make it even better than it is\ntoday! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\nGetting started\nPlease check out one of the getting started guides about GitHub fork / pull requests workflow:\n\nForking project\nFork a repo\nForking\n\nHow to sync your fork\nYour fork of the repo can fall behind as more work is done in the original repository.\nIt is always good idea to update your work before starting to work on new issue.\nThe fork can be updated by navigating to your for directory and running the following command...\ngit checkout master --force && git fetch upstream && git merge upstream/master && git push\nThis command assumes you're using unix or unix like environment (macOS, cygwin, WSL, ...). \nIf not you might need to execute commands one by one instead of chaining them with &&.\nCommit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the change log.\nFormat\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject. \nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\n(): \n\n\n\nType\nCommit types that will appear in changelog:\n\nfeat - adding new feature\nfix - fixing bug (please use fixes # at the end of commit message)\nperf - changes to improve performance\nIf there is BREAKING CHANGE text anywhere in the commit message, the commit will always appear in the changelog\n\nOther types that will not appear in changelog:\n\ndocs - changes in documentation\nchore - changes in build or other application unrelated changes\nrefactor - changes to implementation without changes to functionality\ntest - adding tests\nstyle - changes to codestyle (should be unnecessary since we use prettier)\n\nAny line of the commit message should not be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nScope\nThe commit scope is specified inside of the parentheses. Scope can be omitted when changed\nrelates to multiple modules or even whole project. If possible, scope should refer to a module where change was performed.\nApproximate steps to specify scope:\n\nchange belongs to a well defined module like core, shared, app, ...\nchange belongs to a \"separated\" bigger chung of a module (eg: todos from the examples module)\nchange belongs to a unique cross-cutting concern like animations, logging or build\nchange belongs to a unique entity like readme or contributing\n\nExamples\nfix(polyfills): add missing hammerjs, fixes #247refactor(settings): reorder importstest(todos): add dispatch filter action test, adjust existing testsfix(app): rework main layout to prevent scrollbar issues, closes #221, closes #240docs(readme): add logo, update meta assetsfeat(settings): add runtime animations togglesfix(animations): fix dynamic animations in prod build, fixes #71chore(release): 6.0.1Even more examples of commit messages from commit history of this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n

@tomastrajan\n    \n\n \n\n\nTable of Content\n\nLive Demo\nGetting Started\nUseful Commands\nMake It Your Own\nGoals\nLearning Materials\nList of Projects Built Using This Starter\nFeatures\nStack\nCode of Conduct\nContributors Guide\nChangelog ( get notified about the newest releases, follow Release Butler on Twitter )\n\nGetting started\ngit clone https://github.com/tomastrajan/angular-ngrx-material-starter.git new-project\ncd new-project\nnpm install\nnpm startUseful Commands\n\nnpm start - starts a dev server and opens browser with running app\nnpm run test - runs lint and tests\nnpm run watch - runs tests in watch mode\nnpm run cy:open - opens the Cypress Test Runner in interactive mode\nnpm run cy:run - runs Cypress tests via the cli\nnpm run prod - runs full prod build and serves prod bundle\nnpm run prettier - runs prettier to format whole code base (.ts and .scss) \nnpm run analyze - runs full prod build and webpack-bundle-analyzer to visualize how much code is shipped (dependencies & application) \n\n\nRun Inside Docker Container\n\ndocker build -t material-starter . - builds docker image with name material-starter\ndocker run -it \\\n-v ${PWD}:/usr/src/app \\\n-v /usr/src/app/node_modules \\\n-p 4200:4200 \\\n--rm \\\nmaterial-starter - starts material-starter container (you can access running application browsing http://localhost:4200) \nMake It Your Own\nWhen using this starter project to build your own app you might consider some of the following steps:\n\nuse search and replace functionality of your favourite IDE to replace anms with \n\nrename project in package.json name property and set appropriate version (eg 0.0.0 or 1.0.0)\nremove / rename context path config -- --deploy-url /angular-ngrx-material-starter/ --base-href /angular-ngrx-material-starter in package.json, this is used to configure url (context path) on which the application will be available (eg. https://www.something.com//)\nrename app in src/environments/ files (will be shown in browser tab)\ndelete pre-existing CHANGELOG.md (you will generate your own with future releases of your features)\ndelete CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and BUILT_WITH.md files as they are relevant only if project is open sourced on Github\nedit the title and Open Graph metadata properties in index.html\nremove or adjust links in the footer\nreplace logo in src/assets folder ( currently 128 x 128 pixel png file )\nadjust colors in src/themes/default-theme.scss\ncreate a pull request in the original repository to update BUILT_WITH.md file with a link and short description of your project\n\nContinuous Integration\nStarter project is using Travis CI for running linters and tests on every commit.\nBased on your preferences and needs you can either:\n\nnot use / use other CI server and delete both .travis.yml and .travis-deploy.sh\ncreate Travis CI account and link it to your projects Github repo and configure build \nwith GH_REF and GH_TOKEN environment variables for automatic deployment of releases to Github Pages\n\nGoals\nThe main goal of this repository is to provide an up to date example of Angular application following all recent best practices in various areas like:\n\n@ngrx/store - including reducers, actions, selectors\n@ngrx/effects - for implementation of side effects like http requests, logging, notifications,...\n@ngrx/entity - for CRUD operations\n@ngrx/router-store - to connect the Angular Router to @ngrx/store\n@ngrx/store-devtools - to enable a powerful time-travelling debugger.\n@angular/material - material design component library, theming, ...\nrouting\ntesting of all the above mentioned concepts\nAngular CLI configuration (prod build, budgets, ...)\nend to end tests - a comparison between Protractor and Cypress\n\nThis repository will also strive to always stay in sync with releases of Angular and the related libraries.\nThe nature of the repository is also a great match for first time open source contributors who can add\nsimple features and enhance test coverage, all contributors are more than welcome!\nLearning Materials\nArticles with content that explains various approaches used to build this starter project.\n\nBlog post about Best subscribing to RxJS Observable data by Components: subscribe() vs | async pipe\nBlog post about Best Practices for Angular CLI used in this starter project\nBlog post about Typescript tips for Ngrx reducer code\nBlog post about building responsive layouts with Bootstrap 4 in Angular apps\nBlog post about configuration of animations during runtime\nBlog post about unit testing of components with NgRx TestStore\nBlog post about Angular CLI budgets\n\nTheming\n\nBlog post\nPresentation (Slides)\nLive coding Video Tutorial\nMeetup Presentation & Live coding Video\n\nFeatures\n\ncustom themes support (4 themes included)\nlazy-loading of feature modules\nlazy reducers\nlocalStorage ui state persistence\n@ngrx/effects for API requests\nfully responsive design\nangular-material and custom components in SharedModule\nCypress for end to end tests\n\nStack\n\nAngular\nngrx (or try ngx-model if you prefer less boilerplate)\nAngular Material\nBootstrap 4 (only reset, utils and grids)\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nBlocking at emitting LicenseWebpackPlugin when npm start - try using cnpm instead of npm\n\nContributors\nWant to start contributing to open source with Angular?\nLeave your mark and join the growing team of
